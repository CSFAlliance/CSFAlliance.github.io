# Reflection

## 1. Group

The reflection of the group is on the project period between 13/11/2023 and 30/01/2024. We all came from different directions and did not know each other. After some start-up problems we are reasonably satisfied with the final result.

- **Result:** 
  - The result developed enormously in the last days before the presentation. Due to some start-up problems and poor communication, our process did not get off the ground. The last weeks we did everything possible to create a nice result. We are reasonably satisfied with it.

- **Group Process:** 
  - We are 4 students and all studying something different. This brought nice qualities to our project. With the programming knowledge of Bram and Robert cool things came out. And Daniela and Karlijn showed their architectural side. In general, we waited too much. Tasks were divided and it was trusted that this would then happen. After a while this was not the case, fortunately we discovered this in time and solved it by setting clear deadlines.

## 2. Group Communication

In the beginning, communication ran pretty okay, however, we started using a lot of online platforms. Documents were sent in whatsapp, via one drive and github. After a while, this became confusing and we decided to work mainly via one drive and later github. Looking back now, the communication could be better, we had clearly divided the tasks but because not everyone kept each other informed we became a bit of an island. Daniela and Karlijn took the lead in this and made sure everyone kept to their tasks neatly and on time.
