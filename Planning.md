# Planning 
## Proces
### Design goals
The goal of this project is to design a building at the Schieblock, located in Rotterdam. Before designing a building, we thought about what our goals for the building were. And what facilities the building should have. According to the assignment, there should be space for 400 student units, 200 starter units, and 200 elderly units. In addition, it was decided to create common areas. There is a goal policy that contains: 
1. Green
2. Safe 
3. Togetherness 
4. Sustainable 
5. accessible

In addition, we want to adhere to the following rules: 
- Create a space where different residents can come together.  
- The building is not only a place to live but also a place to find relaxation in the common areas or with other residents 

### Residents
The building must require a total of 800 units which are divided into:

**400 students units:**

- 50% single student studios with bathroom and kitchen
- 25% units part of a multi-dwelling apartment for 4 students with a shared bathroom, kitchen, and living space
- 25% units part of multi-dwelling apartments for 8 students 

Multi dwellings must be separated from the elderly units and the starter units because of the nuisance.

The areas of the units and shared spaces are determined as follows:

- **Studio's:**
  - ca. 25 m2 (source: 24m2)
  
- **Multi dwellings:**
  - ca. 15 m2 personal rooms (source: 18m2) 
  - ca. 7 m2 shared space per person, with a minimum of 20m2 and a maximum of 40m2


**200 elderly units:**

- All units must be single level, accessible by elevator and wheelchair, exterior space needed when space is larger than 40m2 with the sunlight of min. 5m^2
- 50% Independent living (85 m2)
- 50% Assisted living (60 m2)
- Assisted living in close range to care centre and physical-therapy center


**200 starter units**

- Two-bedroom units:
  - Safe for children (no split-level)
  - Shared outdoor space for children to play around
  - 85m2

**Overall units:**

- Living space within the units requires equivalent daylight area minimum of 0.5m^2

This building is going to be mixed-use with the following usage functions:

- Care centre for elderly
  - Accessible by elevator, wheelchair
- Shared working space
- Gym/sport centre
- Restaurant

**Area requirements / exterior requirements**

**Parking**

- A parking requirement of 1.33 bike parking spots per resident
- 0.8 car parking spot per appropriate dwelling
- Separate 10 bike parking spots and 4 car parking spots per 200 m^2
- Bike and car parking for dwellings should be secure and only accessible for residents, while the additional bike and car parking should be publicly accessible.

Considering these requirements it was calculated that 400 car spots are needed for residents, with an additional 30 spots for the extra facilities. Using standard car spot sizes and lane sizes, this means 10,200 m2 of car parking is required.
For bikes, it was calculated that 1,064 bike spots for residents are needed, with an additional 70 spots for the extra facilities. This was translated to a minimum of 852 m2 needed for bike parking, including the bike stalls and lanes between those stalls.

**Greenery**

- Areas for greenery equal to the total surface area of the plot (approx. 8,000m^2 excluding the Biergarten) should be kept on the plot. Apply more greenery on green roofs, vertical façades, stepped terraces, etc...
- The building will incorporate a system for rain harvesting. This system should at least be able to collect and store rainwater from the site preferably also the neighborhood. Part of the stored water should be reused by the building complex

**Safety & Privacy**

- A degree of social control should be present in your design for the building complex. This means that public spaces such as inner courtyards or corridors should be visible from at least a few dwellings so that there is some ‘overview’ by residents.
